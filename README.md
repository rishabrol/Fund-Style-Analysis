# Fund-Style-Analysis
The primary goal of this project is to uncover and interpret the time-varying style exposures of five mutual funds using a quantitative framework. Specific objectives include:
1. Applying rolling regression to identify factor exposures using RBSA methodology
2. Comparing outputs across three levels of model constraint to assess interpretability
3. Validating exposure results against Morningstar classifications for each fund
4. Quantifying alpha, R-squared, and the contribution of each factor to return variance
5. Producing clear visualizations that communicate style drift, consistency, or deviation over time
6. The code created is in R-code but the methodology is valif in python as well.
