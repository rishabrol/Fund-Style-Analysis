# Fund-Style-Analysis
The primary goal of this project is to uncover and interpret the time-varying style exposures of five mutual funds using a quantitative framework. Specific objectives include:
• Applying rolling regression to identify factor exposures using RBSA methodology
• Comparing outputs across three levels of model constraint to assess interpretability
• Validating exposure results against Morningstar classifications for each fund
• Quantifying alpha, R-squared, and the contribution of each factor to return variance
• Producing clear visualizations that communicate style drift, consistency, or deviation over time
